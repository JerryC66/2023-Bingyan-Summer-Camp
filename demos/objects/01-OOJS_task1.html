<!-- 
Add a new method to the Shape class's prototype, calcPerimeter(), which calculates its perimeter (the length of the shape's outer edge) and logs the result to the console.
Create a new instance of the Shape class called square. Give it a name of square and a sideLength of 5.
Call your calcPerimeter() method on the instance, to see whether it logs the calculation result to the browser DevTools'
console as expected.
Create a new instance of Shape called triangle, with a name of triangle and a sideLength of 3.
Call triangle.calcPerimeter() to check that it works OK.
